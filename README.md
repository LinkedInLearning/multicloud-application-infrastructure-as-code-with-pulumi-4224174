## Course Description

In this course, learn how to harness the power of multicloud architectures using Pulumi. Instructor Adora Nwodo covers the core concepts of multicloud environments and explores the intricacies of deploying applications across AWS and Azure. From conceptual understanding to practical application, Adora delves into topics such as multicloud strategies, stack management, configuration, and disaster recovery. Plus, learn about writing Pulumi code to provision resources in multicloud environments and implement multi-region deployments for enhanced resilience. This course teaches not only the foundational principles of multicloud architectures, but also the practical skills necessary to deploy, manage, and optimize multicloud applications effectively.

The project is organized into three main chapters, corresponding to different aspects of Pulumi-based infrastructure-as-code (IaC) deployments across multiple cloud providers.
